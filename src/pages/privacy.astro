        <div>
            This document outlines the Privacy Policy of "FrameOCR" macOS desktop app,
            and applies to the most recent version of the app. By using FrameOCR, you
            acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

                <b>Screen Recording.</b> To function correctly, FrameOCR requires macOS Screen
                Recording permission to take screenshots. All screenshots taken by FrameOCR
                belong to the user and are controlled by the user. Screenshots are stored
                and processed locally on the user's device, and any information derived from
                the screenshots never leaves the user's device.
                
                <br /><br />
                
                <b>Text Recognition (OCR).</b> When the user engages the OCR feature, text
                recognition happens locally on the user's computer, both the image and the
                recognized text are never transferred over the internet by FrameOCR.
                
                <br /><br />
                
                <b>Notification Permissions.</b> Notification Permissions are required only
                if the user wishes FrameOCR to notify them when OCR processing has finished.

            <p class="mt-2">
                FrameOCR uses the internet connection for various tasks (see the list
                below). FrameOCR does require internet connection to validate the
                license key number; other than that FrameOCR will operate correctly on
                computers that don't have an internet connection, or if the user
                restricts its access to the internet using third-party tools.
            </p>
            <br/>
            FrameOCR may contact frameocr.com server on the following occasions:
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li>To validate or revalidate the license number.</li>
                <!-- <li>
                If the user engages the “Upload” feature (see the Screenshot Uploading
                Privacy Policy).
                </li> -->
                <li>
                    On app launch and once every few days FrameOCR checks
                    <code>https://frameocr.com/api/version.json</code> for information about
                    update availability. If a new version is found, FrameOCR will offer the
                    user to download the update, but will not perform the update without the
                    user's confirmation.

                FrameOCR reaches the telemetry endpoint to send diagnostic information
                to frameocr.com if the appropriate setting is turned on in the app
                Preferences.

        <p class="mt-2">
        Anonymized information may be captured and transmitted to the
        frameocr.com server, including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
        <li>Performance metrics</li>
        <li>Error codes</li>
        <li>Frequency and parameters of feature usage</li>
        <li>Randomly generated computer identifier</li>
        <li>OS version</li>
        <li>Screen resolution and number of external screens</li>
        <li>Internationalization preferences and timezone</li>
        <li>App version</li>
        <li>App preferences that don't contain private information</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">
        The user license number is not included into the diagnostics data
        stream, but is transmitted to the server for the license verification
        purposes. The upload token is not included into the diagnostics data
        stream, but is transmitted when the image is being uploaded online.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
        The application doesn't have access to the user email, name, and address
        — this information will never be transmitted as part of the telemetry
        data stream. No images are ever transmitted as part of the telemetry
        data stream. The text that the user provides (by typing in the
        application or by recognizing it from the image) is never included in
        the telemetry data stream.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
        When the telemetry collection is turned off, one final report to the
        server is made signaling that the data collection will stop. When
        telemetry is off, events may still be recorded locally on the user's
        computer, but they won't be sent to the server.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
        When the diagnostics telemetry is turned off, the app stops sharing
        diagnostics information, but continues using endpoints to check for
        updates, verify license information and upload images when the upload
        feature is engaged; some information (including, but not limited to:
        license number, upload token) will be passed to the server as part of
        this process.
        </p>

        The collected information is solely used to provide service, develop and
        further improve the app.

                When the user purchases the license number for the app, their name,
                address, phone number and credit card information are collected and
                processed by the payment processing company (Lemon Squeezy). This
                information is treated with the utmost confidentiality and is not shared

                The frameocr.com server does not store or process name, phone number,
                address, or credit card information associated with the transaction. It
                does process and store the email address associated with the license key
                number for the purposes of processing the transaction and providing
                customer support.

                FrameOCR (the application) stores the license number when it's entered

                address, however, the IP address may be temporarily stored in the Cloudflare
                log files. Cloudflare log files aren't being analyzed, processed, or mapped
