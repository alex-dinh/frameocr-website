        </h2>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Is there a free trial?</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            FrameOCR is free to use and evaluate, and after 7 days it will start 
            asking you to consider upgrading. If it helped you be more productive 
            and saved you time, please consider purchasing the app!

            Is the purchase a one-time payment or a subscription?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            Your purchase is a one-time payment, not a subscription.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">
            What languages are supported by the text recognition engine?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            English, Afrikaans, Albanian, Belarusian, Bosnian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, 
            Danish, Dutch, Estonian, French, German, Hungarian, Korean, Icelandic, Indonesian, 
            Irish, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Lithuanian, Malay, Maori, Norwegian, Occitan, 
            Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, 
            Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Vietnamese, Welsh.
            <br/><br/>
            The Chinese OCR processing supports Simplified Chinese (简中), Traditional Chinese (繁中), 
            and Pinyin (拼音).
            <br/><br/>
            For Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, auto-detection of text orientation is also supported 
            (as of v1.2.0). If the auto-detection isn't working (which may happen for strangely 
            structured text), you can also manually specify this setting to horizontal or vertical. 
            If the detected text is vertical, then a right-to-left reading direction is assumed.
            <br/><br/>
            Remember to select your target language in the app settings so that
            the best model can be used (Settings > General > OCR Language).

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">
            Does FrameOCR use cloud OCR processing?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            No, FrameOCR runs all OCR processing entirely locally and offline on 
            your machine. That means there is no limit to how much you can use 
            the text or LaTeX recognition features.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">
            What programming language is FrameOCR written in?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
            FrameOCR is written entirely in Swift 6, built natively for macOS.
